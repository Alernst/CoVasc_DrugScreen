The here shown embedding tool designed for 3D printing has been adapted from Wittbrodt et al.,2014 ( https://bmcbiotechnol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6750-14-36).


The here described design is made to be printed as whole in one piece and made for lateral embedding of zebrafish larvae. Our tests so far show very good performance at 4.5 dpf, using Greiner (655101) 96-well plates. 

Preparation: 
1. Add 65 µL of Agarose to each well (Agarose: Low melting or normal, should be as clear as possible without autofluorescence); 
2. Quickly remove air bubble with a metal needle or forceps; 
3. Press mold into the plate; 
4. Wait 0.5-1 h at RT or 15-30 min at 4°C. 
   Comment on step 4: One problem is that the plastic material is bending over time and the base plate will not be completely flat anymore. This problem can be solved by putting a weight on top during step 4.  
5. Pull out the mold evenly
6. Either fill the wells with your sample immediately or wrap the prepared dish in a wet tissue, put it in a plastic bag and store it over night at 4°C.
